    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Air quality is a growing concern in India, with major cities consistently ranking amongst the most polluted in the world. Particulate Matter (PM), particularly PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) and PM10 (particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter), pose significant health risks. The Indian government has recognized the urgency of addressing air pollution and has outlined plans to improve air quality monitoring and mitigation strategies.</p>

    <section id="current-monitoring">
      <h2>Current Air Quality Monitoring Network</h2>
      <p>The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) spearheads air quality monitoring in India through the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). As of August 2023, NAMP utilizes a network of over 800 operating stations across 344 cities/towns.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Monitoring Parameters:** Primarily SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10.</li>
        <li>**Data Collection Frequency:** Twice a week, 24-hour data collection.</li>
        <li>**Data Analysis and Dissemination:** AQI derived from data and made publicly available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="government-initiatives">
      <h2>Government Initiatives for Improved AQI Monitoring</h2>
      <p>The Indian government has proposed several initiatives to enhance AQI monitoring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Network Expansion:** More stations, including rural and industrial areas.</li>
        <li>**PM2.5 & PM10 Focus:** Real-time data collection for these pollutants.</li>
        <li>**Continuous Monitoring:** Upgrade to real-time data collection.</li>
        <li>**Low-Cost Sensors:** Exploring wider data coverage with sensor technology.</li>
        <li>**Data Sharing & Collaboration:** Improved collaboration between agencies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="expected-benefits">
      <h2>Expected Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved data accuracy and coverage.</li>
        <li>Enhanced public awareness with real-time AQI information.</li>
        <li>Targeted policy interventions for air pollution sources.</li>
        <li>Citizen science and community engagement through low-cost sensors.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Funding and resource allocation for network expansion and technology upgrade.</li>
        <li>Ensuring consistent data quality across various monitoring agencies.</li>
        <li>Public education and capacity building for air quality awareness and behavior change.</li>
        <li>Inter-state and regional cooperation for effective solutions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Air quality monitoring is critical for addressing air pollution in India. The government's planned initiatives hold promise for a more robust AQI monitoring system with a focus on PM2.5 and PM10. Overcoming the challenges and fostering collaboration will be essential for ensuring clean air for all Indian citizens.</p>
