        <p>Unlike weather prediction, which focuses on future atmospheric conditions, Air Quality Monitoring (AQI)  
            tracks the current state of the air we breathe. 
            
            <img class="image1" src="./aqi.png" width="200" height="200">
            <br><br> Similar to weather data collection, AQI monitoring relies on a network of ground stations and satellites. These stations measure pollutants like ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5), providing real-time data on the Air Quality Index (AQI)           
            <br><br>Computer models are used to simulate the atmosphere by solving mathematical equations that describe the physical processes that occur in the atmosphere.
            <br>The models take into account a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.
            
            <br><br> The AQI simplifies this data into a color-coded system, allowing you to quickly understand how healthy the air is to breathe. Many government agencies and independent organizations provide online resources to check the AQI in your area.  
            <br><br>For example, you can find the current AQI for Chandigarh, India on aqi.in.

            Air Qualitity Monitoring is a complex process that involves a variety of different disciplines, including physics, mathematics, and computer science. However, the basic principles of AQI are relatively simple:
            <br>    <br>
            The atmosphere is a fluid, and it behaves in accordance with the laws of physics.

            <br>The Air Quality is constantly changing, and these changes are driven by a variety of factors, such as the <b>Particulate Matter</b>, the Ozone Layer, and the presence of various and other gases in the air.
            <br><br>By understanding the physical processes that drive the AQI, scientists can develop computer models that can simulate how the AQI will effect the Living diversity.
            <br>AQI Monitoring System is a vital tool for a wide range of applications. By providing accurate AQI, meteorologists can help to protect lives and property, and to save money.</p>
